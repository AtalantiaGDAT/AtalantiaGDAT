# Atalantia - Stroke Rehabilitation Project

## Introduction
This project is an Engineering Projects In Community Service (EPICS) at Purdue University and is part of the Global Design for Assistive Technology (GDAT) team. We are Atalanatia, a subteam of GDAT. We are working to help our project partner, Croi House, and their stroke therapy patients by providing them with an at-home therapy solution that is more interactive and engaging for their exercise.
